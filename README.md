# Health Blog Web App

## Description

This is a simple health blog web application developed during the first year of my bachelor's degree. The app allows users to explore various health-related articles and calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) using an integrated calculator. It is built using basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery.

## Features

- Browse through different health articles.
- Integrated **BMI Calculator** for users to check their Body Mass Index.
- Simple, user-friendly interface.
- Responsive design for a better experience on mobile and desktop devices.

## Development Tools

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity, including the BMI calculator.
- **jQuery**: For simplifying DOM manipulation and handling events more easily.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefrajoul/health-blog.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd health-blog
   ```

3. **Open the application in your browser:**

   - If you are using a live server extension or a local development server, use the following URL:

   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:<your-port-number>/index.html
   ```

   - Replace your-port-number with the port your server is running on (e.g., 5500, 3000, etc.).

   - Alternatively, you can open the index.html file directly in your web browser by navigating to the file location on your computer.

## Usage

- Browse health articles directly from the homepage.
- Use the **BMI Calculator** by entering your height and weight to check your BMI.
- The website is static and does not require any backend or database setup.
